<h1> Lists Instead Of Trees </h1>

Technically, the data structure is a "b-link tree" - a b-tree where each node
has a pointer to its right-hand peer, if any. In some variants, including this
one, some parent-child pointers may at times be missing from the tree
structure. Readers use the peer-peer pointers to navigate to child pages for
which the parent-child pointer is missing.

In our opinion though, the data structure is more easily understood as a
series of loosely coupled linked-lists.

<verbatim type="pikchr center">
boxht=0.2 ; boxwid=0.5

box "1" ; arrow ; box "2" ; arrow ; box "3" ; arrow ; box "4" ;
</verbatim>

Adding a node:

<verbatim type="pikchr center">
boxht=0.2 ; boxwid=0.5

box "1" ; arrow ; TWO: box "2" ; arrow ; box "3" ; arrow ; box "4" ;

FIVE: box at TWO + (-0.5, -0.3) "5" color red
arrow from FIVE.e to TWO.s color red
</verbatim>

<verbatim type="pikchr center">
boxht=0.2 ; boxwid=0.5

ONE: box "1" color red ; move ; TWO: box "2" ; arrow ; box "3" ; arrow ; box "4"

FIVE: box at TWO + (-0.5, -0.3) "5"
arrow from FIVE.e to TWO.s
arrow from ONE.s to FIVE.w color red
</verbatim>

Removing a node:

<verbatim type="pikchr center">
boxht=0.2 ; boxwid=0.5

box "1" ; arrow ; box "2" ; arrow ; THREE: box "3" color red; arrow color red; box "4" 
circle "X" radius 0.05 color red at THREE.ne fill white
</verbatim>

<verbatim type="pikchr center">
boxht=0.2 ; boxwid=0.5

box "1" ; arrow ; TWO: box "2" color red; move ; THREE: box "3"; arrow; FOUR: box "4" 
circle "X" radius 0.05 at THREE.ne fill white

arrow from TWO.e right 0.1 then right 0.3 down 0.3 then right until even with FOUR.w then to FOUR.s color red
</verbatim>
