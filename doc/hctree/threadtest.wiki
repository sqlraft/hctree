<h1> Thread Test </h1>

<p>This project contains no code stable enough to deploy. The database backend
works well enough to run some test cases, but 
<a href=index.html#status>is still quite incomplete</a>.

<p>Even so, the prototype is advanced enough to use to test whether or not
multiple writers really can run concurrently on multi-processor systems.
That is the goal of the tests on this page - to verify the extent that
the database allows multiple clients in separate application threads to
run concurrent read/write transactions.

<p>Performance is compared to stock SQLite modified with the begin-concurrent
and wal2 patches (system "bcw2"). This is to show that single-threaded
performance is similar to stock SQLite, and that multi-threaded performance is,
for some cases at least, already better than is possible with SQLite.

<h1>Test Overview</h1>

<p>All tests use the same database. The schema is:

<pre>
      CREATE TABLE tbl(
         a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
         b BLOB(200),
         c CHAR(64)
      );
      CREATE INDEX tbl_i1 ON tbl(substr(c, 1, 16));
      CREATE INDEX tbl_i2 ON tbl(substr(c, 2, 16));
</pre>

<p>The initial database contains 1,000,000 rows. Column "a" contains values
1 to 1,000,000. Column "b" contains a 200 byte blob value. Column "c"
contains a 64 byte text value.

<p>Each test consists of between 1 and 16 threads, all running transactions
as fast as possible for 30 seconds. Each transaction consists of:

<pre>
      BEGIN;
        -- repeat <i>nScan</i> times:
        SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE substr(c, 1, 16)>=hex(frandomblob(8)) ORDER BY substr(c, 1, 16) LIMIT 10;
</pre>
<pre>
        -- repeat <i>nUpdate</i> times:
        UPDATE tbl SET b=updateblob(b, ?, ?), c=hex(frandomblob(32)) WHERE a = ?;
      COMMIT;
</pre>

<p>Where <i>nScan</i> and <i>nUpdate</i> are parameters for the test. Four
separate tests are run, with different values for <i>nScan</i> and
<i>nUpdate</i>:

  *  <b>update1</b>: nUpdate=1, nScan=0
  *  <b>update10</b>: nUpdate=10, nScan=0
  *  <b>update1_scan10</b>: nUpdate=1, nScan=10
  *  <b>update10_scan10</b>: nUpdate=10, nScan=10

Prepared statements are used while testing - the SQL compiler is not run during the tests.

<p>The SQLite/begin-concurrent/wal2 - bcw2 - tests use code from the
begin-concurrent-pnu-wal2 branch. They are configured as follows:

<pre>
      PRAGMA journal_mode = wal2;
      PRAGMA mmap_size = 1000000000;
      PRAGMA synchronous = off;
      PRAGMA journal_size_limit = 16777216;
</pre>

Additionally:

  *  All "COMMIT" operations are protected by an application mutex.

  *  One thread is designated the checkpointer. Checkpoints are performed
     outside the mutex when the system indicates that one is possible via
     the wal-hook (i.e. when there is 16MB of checkpointable data in
     one wal file).

  *  The VFS is "unix-excl", so no system calls are made for locks, and the
     mutex-free locking patch has been applied.

<h1 id=results>Test Results</h1>

All tests were run on a 16-core AMD 5950X processor with 32G of memory
using tmpfs for a file-system. Advanced BIOS CPU frequency management features
like "Core Boost", "AMD Cool & Quiet" and "Simultaneous Multi-Threading" are
all disabled.
